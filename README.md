# C# Address Book
## Created by Charles Emrich

### Description
A barebones implementation of a system for storing contact information. Currently, it enables the user to browse a list of their contacts, make a new one, clear the contact list, and view a more detailed list of a contact's information.

### Installation
1. Download or clone the repository from [here](https://github.com/CharlesEmrich/address-book-cs.git)
2. Start the app by running dnx kestrel, or a similar local-server-starting command in your terminal of choice.
3. Point your web browser to localhost:5004 to begin using the app.

### Known Bugs
Current implementation of Search functionality is case-sensitive.
